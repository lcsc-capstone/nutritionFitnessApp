<h1>Buenos Aires</h1>
Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. "Buenos Aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 14 million.

<h1>Best Food</h1>
Argentine cuisine is described as a cultural blending of Mediterranean influences (such as those created by Italian and Spanish populations) with and very small inflows (mainly in border areas), Indigenous, within the wide scope of agricultural products that are abundant in the country. Argentine annual consumption of beef has averaged 100 kg (220 lbs) per capita,[1] approaching 180 kg (396 lbs) per capita during the 19th century; consumption averaged 67.7 kg (149 lbs) in 2007. Beyond asado (the Argentine barbecue), no other dish more genuinely matches the national identity. Nevertheless, the country's vast area, and its cultural diversity, have led to a local cuisine of various dishes. The great immigratory waves consequently imprinted a large influence in the Argentine cuisine, after all Argentina was the second country in the world with the most immigrants with 6.6 million, only second to the United States with 27 million, and ahead of other immigratory receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.

<h1>Unique Vegetation</h1>
The traditional wealth of Argentina lies in the vast Pampas, which are used for extensive grazing and grain production. However, Argentine timber and mineral resources, especially offshore deposits of petroleum and natural gas, have assumed increasing importance.

The indigenous vegetation of Argentina varies greatly with the different climates and geographic regions of the country.

<div class="col-3">
<h1>Friendly people</h1>
Argentine people have a reputation for their love of eating. Social gatherings are commonly centered on sharing a meal. Invitations to have dinner at home is generally viewed as a symbol of friendship, warmth, and integration. Sunday family lunch is considered the most significant meal of the week, whose highlights often include asado or pasta.

Another feature of Argentine cuisine is the preparation of homemade food such as french fries, patties, and pasta to celebrate a special occasion, to meet friends, or to honor someone. The tradition of locally preparing food is passed down from generation to generation, and homemade food is also seen as a way to show affection.

Argentine restaurants include a great variety of cuisines, prices, and flavors.[3] Large cities tend to host everything from high-end international cuisine, to bodegones (inexpensive traditional hidden taverns), less stylish restaurants, and bars and canteens offering a range of dishes at affordable prices.

El polo es un deporte de equipos, en el que dos conjuntos con cuatro jinetes cada uno, montados a caballo, intentan llevar una pequeña pelota de madera o plástico hacia la portería del rival, formada por dos postes de mimbre, por medio de un taco o mazo. El objetivo consiste en marcar la mayor cantidad de goles. El deporte tradicional del polo se juega en un campo de hierba de 270 por 150 metros (equivalentes a 300 por 260 yardas). Es un deporte antiguo, cuya práctica se remonta a hace más de dos mil años atrás, y cuyo origen probable se halla en Asia Central.2​ Hoy en día, el juego moderno tiene una duración aproximada de dos horas, y se divide en seis períodos o tiempos llamados chukkas o chukkers. Es jugado competitivamente por selecciones de los cinco continentes. More info at: <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_(deporte)">https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_(deporte)</a>
